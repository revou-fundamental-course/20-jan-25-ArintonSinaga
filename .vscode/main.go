To initialize a new Go module for your project, you can use the `go mod init` command. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to your project folder:
	```
	cd /c:/Users/FOFI INDONESIA/Documents/GitHub/20-jan-25-ArintonSinaga/.vscode
	```
3. Initialize a new Go module:
	```
	go mod init golang-api
	```

This will create a `go.mod` file in your project directory, which will manage your project's dependencies.
